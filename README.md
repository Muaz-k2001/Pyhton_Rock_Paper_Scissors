# Python_Rock_Paper_Scissors

A model was created from https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ for each option possible in a rock-paper-scissors game. This model is going to be used in a game which will be coded using python. The following README file documents the progress made by the creator of the game at each milestone, and will end with the conclusions of what the creator understood from and felt about the project.
